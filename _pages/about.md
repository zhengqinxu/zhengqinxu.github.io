I am a postdoctoral researcher at AI Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from School of Machinery and Automation, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China, in Jun. 2022. Before that I received my master degree from tSchool of Machinery and Automation, Wuhan University of Science and Technology, China, in Jun. 2019 and B.E degree from School School of Machinery Engineering, Hubei University of Technology, China, in Jun. 2015.

My research interest broadly includes machine learning and computer vision. Specifically, I focus on robust low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition, tensor learning, high-dimensional data processing and parameter efficient fine-tuning, etc. I am/was a reviewer for CVPR’(2023-2024), AAAI’2024, ECCV’2024.
